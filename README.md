# UML-Diagrams
## In this repo, I'll try to talk about UML diagrams
### Understanding UML, A Comprehensive Overview:
- UML (Unified Modelling Language) is an essential tool for software developers, offering a standardized set of diagrams to visualize, design, and document software systems. It provides a common notation for communicating complex system designs, aiding in collaboration and validation of architectural decisions. UML encompasses a variety of diagram types, including both structural and behavioural representations, each serving specific modelling purposes. Structural diagrams like class diagrams, component diagrams, and deployment diagrams focus on system architecture and physical aspects, while behavioural diagrams such as use case diagrams and sequence diagrams capture system functionalities and interactions. Understanding UML and its various diagram types is crucial for effective system modelling and software development.

### Behavioural Diagrams
#### 1. Use Case diagram:
- Describes the functional requirements of the system in terms of use cases.
- Allows u to link what u need from the system with how the system meets those needs.

#### 2. Activity diagram:
- Graphical representations of workflows of stepwise activities and actions with the support of choice iteration and concurrency.
- They describe the control flow of the target system such as exploring complex business rules and operations as well as describing the use cases and business processes.
- In UML activity diagrams are meant for modelling both computational and organizational processes.

#### 3. State Machine diagram:
- Describes the system behaviour. 
- Visualize the entire life cycle of objects.

#### 4. Sequence diagram:
- Models the interaction of object based on a time sequence.
- It shows how objects interact with each other in a particular use case.

#### 5. Communication diagram:
- Similar to sequence diagram is a communication diagram, it also used to model the dynamic behaviour of a use case, when compared to sequence diagram communication diagram focuses more on showing object collaborations rather than the time sequence (in fact both are semantically equivalent and one can be generated from the another)

#### 6. Interaction Overview diagram:
- Focuses on the overview of the flow of the control of the interactions(this is a variant of activity diagram where the nodes are the interactions).
- Describes interactions in which messages and lifelines are hidden, we can link up the real diagrams and achieve a high degree of navigation between diagrams within an interaction overview diagram.

#### 7. Timing diagram:
- Shows the behaviour of the object or objects at a given time period, In fact this is a special form of sequence diagram and the differences between them are that the axes are swapped, So that the time increases from left to right and the lifelines are displayed in separate compartments arranged vertically.
